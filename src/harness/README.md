# The SAS Test Harness

This folder contains code and testcases for SAS certification test as defined in
"CBRS Release 2 Regulatory Impacting (RI) Test Specification for SAS as UUT" (WINNF-TS-4006).

## Code prerequisites

To be determined.

## Alignment to Release 1 Testcases

To the maximum extent possible, testcase code from 
[Release 1 Spectrum Access System](https://github.com/Wireless-Innovation-Forum/Spectrum-Access-System)
will be reused in developing Release 2 testcases.

Alignment assessments for each test case are provided in:

    ./rel1_alignment

In most cases, there is not a perfect alignment between Release 1 testcases and Release 2 requirements.

## Code Location
